# Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse Course

## Session 5

The topic of this session is **Data Modelling** (in particular, data warehouse modelling). This repository includes the content discussed in class:

  - Datasets
  - Videos
  - Articles

## Main Concepts

  - Data Warehouse design and implementation

## How to use this content

  - Watch the videos
  - If you want to reproduce download the dataset (sakila-dwh) and install the programs
  - Required Software:
	  - MySQL
	  - MySQL Workbench
  - All schemas have been created with MySQL Workbench.
  
## What you can learn in the videos

## FAQ

### How to choose between CIF, MD or Data Vault?

  - CIF (Inmon): Easy to maintain; Structured; Easier data mining; Timely to build
  - MD (Kimball): Start small, scale big; Faster ROI; Analytical Tools; Low reusability
  - Data Vault (Lyndsted); Backend Data Warehouse; Multiple sources; Full history; Incremental build; Up-front work; Long-term payoff; Many joins

### Is there a data warehouse lifecycle?

Yes. It comprises many iterative steps.

### How to backup a database in MySQL?

Check this [explanation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-admin-export-import-management.html).

### Is is important DW/ETL Testing?

Yes. Read this article about this [topic](https://www.guru99.com/utlimate-guide-etl-datawarehouse-testing.html).

### Is it possible to consider automated testing in a data warehouse?

Yes. Read this interesting [article](https://medium.com/@josh.temple/automated-testing-in-the-modern-data-warehouse-d5a251a866af) about the topic. A potential tool to use is [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com). 

### What can I do if I don't have access to the data yet?

You can generate random data to start working. For example, you can use [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) or [GenerateData](http://generatedata.com).

Another option is to generate synthetic data. There are many differen approaches that can be categorized into three main groups: **synthetic reconstruction**, **combinatorial optimization**, and **model-based generation**.
